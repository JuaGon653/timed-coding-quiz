# timed-coding-quiz

## Description

For my 5th challenge in in the coding bootcamp, I was prompted to create a mock up of an assessment test that you would typically see in the interview process. The requirements for this challenge were when the 'Start Quiz' button is pressed a timer starts and you are asked several questions. Once the questions are over with or the timer runs out, you are then prompted for your initials in order to keep track of your scores that are stored in the local storage. Then, when the 'Submit' button is pressed, the scores pop up in order from highest to lowest score with the initials also being displayed next to the score. Then with a click of a button you should be able to either clear the scores or go back to the starting page to take the quiz again.
